# Quizlet-Scraper-Bot
This is a python script that will scrape the contents of a PDF file and writes them to seperate files of 7500 chars each. Allowing you to make a Quizlet using their new "Create from Notes" AI Feature. 

Will add support in the future for other data types such as pptx, docx, etc...

The quizlets made using this script are quite accurate, tested on a Medical dataset and quizlet is able to successfully make accurate flashcards based off of a PDF document.
